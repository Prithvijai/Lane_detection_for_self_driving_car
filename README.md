# Lane_detection_for_self_driving_car


Road collisions are occurring much more frequent, in India alone the total number of roadway collisions is, more than 207,551 per year, leaving out minor accidents. These accidents are caused due to reckless or inattentive driving. To improve safety manufacturers have used crash sensors but they are only helpful to activate airbags and not prevent a crash. To prevent and safely shift lanes on highways we can use lane detection and sensor fusion to enable an autonomous solution to this issue.
